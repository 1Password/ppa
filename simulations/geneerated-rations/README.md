# Ratios of generated to Non-generated passwords

## Background

Some passwords stored in a 1Password vault or set of vaults belong to a user can be generated by 1Password's generator. 
Others may come from other sources.
For a number of years, passwords created with the generator are distinctively marked within the item. In particular, they have an exact password strength instead of an estimated strength.

### Generated are under counted

Details will go here of the fact that many generated passwords will not be recognized as such.

### Assuming others are human created

Things that are not generated by 1Password may have been generated by other sources, but there is no way for the 1Password client to know that. So the client treats all of those as human created.

### Generated status and strength is e2e encrypted

The (estimated) password strengths and whether they are generated or not is information that is encrypted (ultimately) by the user's account password and Secret Key. Knowing whether any individual's password is generated or human created would give an attacker a great deal of information is selecting targets.

## Approach

For starting, we will take the simplest form local DP possible. We will divide up the ratios of generated to total passwords into $n$ bins.
